# Converting calendars from online

## DC United

They do not provide an ical - they funnel everything through ecal.com, which
wants to have access to your calendar.

Use mls2cal.sh and pass the URL of the team's MLS schedule page. It defaults
to DC United's page. It will print the commands it is running so you can see
how it works if you care.
